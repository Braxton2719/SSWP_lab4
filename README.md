1st Commit - Testing if VS Code GitHub connection works<br>
2nd Commit - Made a character_class function for D&D class Data<br>

4th Commit - Made ability_score function for telling the user about the various D&D ability scores<br>
5th Commit - Finished the character_class function and added the ability scores to the Character model<br>
    -> Debating on if I should have ability scores be set in a separate function or in main<br>
    -> Also need to create option for deciding if a user is sure they want the class they selected<br>
6th Commit - Added functionality to allow a user to decide if they want to keep the class they selected<br>
    -> decided that I'll let the ability score allocation be in a separate function
